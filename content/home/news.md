From 2017 to 2019, three destructive earthquakes (27 January 2017 Mw 4.7, 16 December 2018 Mw 5.2, and 3 January 2019 Mw 4.8) occurred in the Changning shale gas field in the southwest Sichuan Basin, China. Previous seismological studies attributed these events to hydraulic fracturing (HF), but were unable to identify the causative seismogenic faults and their slip behaviors. Here, we use Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data to measure surface deformation triggered by the three events and conduct geodetic inversions to characterize their rupture models. The resulting coseismic interferograms show prominent surface deformation with the maximum line-of-sight displacements of up to 4 cm. The inversion results show that all three earthquakes mainly ruptured sedimentary formations above the shale gas bed, in the upper 3 km of the crust, with slip magnitudes ranging from 8.5 to 15 cm, and stress drops ranging from ∼1.8 to ∼3.3 MPa. Their source faults intersect with horizontal HF wells, but do not root in the crystalline basement. Combined with the reported difficulty of increasing HF operation pressures prior to the three events, we argue that they were most likely induced by direct injection of pressurized fluids into the fault zones. Crustal deformation patterns inferred from regional topography and GPS velocities highlight that the Changning field is located within a triple junction region near the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau with large deformation gradients; such conditions are not only favorable to the development of critically stressed faults, but also facilitate the occurrence of at least moderate magnitude earthquakes.

* The work on the 2021 Mw 7.4 Madoi earthquake has been published in Earth Planetary Physics.

* **Our work on the 2019 Changning earthquake sequence has been published in Geophysical Research Letters.**

In June 2019, an earthquake sequence comprising five M>5 events occurred in a region of southwest China with fluid injection for both hydraulic fracturing and salt mining, which raised an extensive controversy on the cause. Here we use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations to determine the source parameters of the sequence and to investigate the relationship with local injection activities. Both Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 SAR images are collected to measure co- and pre-seismic surface deformation. Geodetic inversions with co-seismic observations show that the sequence ruptured a previously-unmapped southwest-dipping thrust fault above 3 km depth, which intersects with the open-hole sections of wells for solution mining of salt. In the 4 months before the sequence, cumulative line-of-sight displacements near the wells are around 1-2 cm after correcting seasonal-like deformation. Our results indicate that water injection likely enhanced pore pressure within the fault zone and thus contributed to inducing the sequence.
