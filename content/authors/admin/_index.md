Dr. Shuai Wang is a lector of space geodesy at Nanjing Tech University (NJTech). His research interests include, but not limited to, multi-temporal InSAR analysis, large-scale tectonic deformation in the Tibetan Plateau and geodetic inversion. He is a membor of the LOG (Laboratory of Geodesy) reaserch group at NJTech. The group toward to a better understanding of Earth science using the space geodesy (i.e., GRACE, GPS and InSAR).
